# CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
VerademoJS contains hard-coded credentials within code, thus making it vulnerable for an attacker to utilize them to gain access to our app

# Mitigate
* For outbound requests, store credentials outside of the code in a strongly-protected configuration file that has no access to outsiders.
* For inbound requests, apply one-way hashes and store them to configuration files with proper access control, that way the attacker will have to compute more hashes as the password will now have randomly assigned salts for each seperate hash.

# Remediate
* Store credentials outside of code, store in configuration or property files instead.
