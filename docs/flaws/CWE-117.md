# CWE-117: Improper Output Neutralization for Logs
VerademoJS utilizes console logging throughout the code. The issue here is that it is using untrusted data. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious entries through these console logs

## Mitigate
* Validate entries don't contain CR or LF Characters

# Remediate
* Avoid directly embedding input data in log files. Instead sanitize the untrusted data to construct log entries (e.g. JSONStringify)
