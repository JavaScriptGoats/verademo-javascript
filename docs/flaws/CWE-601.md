# CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')
VerademoJS utilizes res.redirect() to redirect the web app to its intended destination. The issue with this approach is that the redirection isn't validated, resulting in open redirect which allows an attacker to redirect to another URL if they wish.

# Mitigate
* Verify that redirect stays within bounds of the app.

# Remediate
* Validate the redirect to ensure it conforms to the expected location . (e.g. function to validate the redirect)
