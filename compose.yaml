# Here the instructions define your application as two services called "todo-app" and “todo-database”
# The service “todo-app” is built from the Dockerfile in the /app directory,
# and the service “todo-database” uses the official MongoDB image 
# from Docker Hub - https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo. 
# You can add other services your application may depend on here.
